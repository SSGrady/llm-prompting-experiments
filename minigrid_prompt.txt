Generate a handul of unique DAGs showing multiple paths from the start to the goal. A “state” is any conjunction of these ground predicates:

Start: OutsideRoom
Goal: Green_Goal
Objects: Key1, Key2, Key3, Door, Lava, Wall
Predicates: At(?), Holding(?), Unlocked(?)
Include intermediate states logically required to move from start to goal, respecting object interactions and valid environment constraints. 
Output the DAGs in JSON as members of a 2D array named "paths", with no extra text. For example:
{"paths": [[
      "At(OutsideRoom)",
      "Holding(Key1)",
      "Unlocked(Door)",
      "At(Green_Goal)"
    ],[
      "At(OutsideRoom)",
      "Holding(Key2)",
      "Unlocked(Door)",
      "At(Green_Goal)"
    ],[
      "At(OutsideRoom)",
      "Holding(Key3)",
      "Unlocked(Door)",
      "At(Green_Goal)"
    ],[
      "At(OutsideRoom)",
      "At(Wall)",
      "At(Green_Goal)"
    ]]}
